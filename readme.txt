./project_joshuanl test2.txt

I've pushed the text files to test the code for convenience.

Bells and Whistle problems attempted: 

1)  (*2 bells and whistles*) STL Data Structures
6)  (*1 bell and whistle*) Actors
7)  (*3 bells and whistles*) The Bacon Game:
11) (*1 bell and whistle*) Modify Ratings
