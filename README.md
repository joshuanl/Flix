To compile:
make clean
rm main
make
./main file.txt

Some output is stylized and intentionally looks different than from assignment for aesthetic purposes

Example, instead of printing
The Princess Bride
comedy
Inigo Montoya
Robin Wright

It will print
The Princess Bride
  COMEDY
  INIGO MONTOYA
  ROBIN WRIGHT

Spaces to show distinction between the movie and the keywords 
And keywords in caps to show consitency between the lowerased "comedy" and names Inigo Montoya

Additional Notes:
>> file.txt needs to be configured with the first line being the movie.txt file then user.txt
